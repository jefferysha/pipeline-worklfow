# Context Bundle Handoff Specification

## Purpose

Define a deterministic, ledger-bound, budgeted context package that a
downstream pipeline phase can verify and consume without replacing canonical
OpenSpec documents or their read receipts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Handoff SHALL compile a deterministic Context Bundle v1

The existing handoff command SHALL support compiling a versioned
`context-bundle/v1` for one exact target phase or role without changing legacy
handoff output. The bundle SHALL contain Change identity, source and target,
governance tier, ordered inputs, each input's document kind, project-relative
path, ledger SHA-256 digest, policy reason, materialization mode, bounded budget
usage, and one aggregate digest over the canonical bundle payload.

#### Scenario: Same inputs produce the same bundle

- **GIVEN** the Change state, policy, ledger records, and source bytes are
  unchanged
- **WHEN** the same target bundle is compiled twice
- **THEN** ordered inputs and aggregate digest are byte-for-byte identical.

#### Scenario: Legacy handoff remains compatible

- **WHEN** the caller does not request bundle mode
- **THEN** the existing text and JSON handoff contracts remain unchanged.

### Requirement: Context Bundle inputs SHALL come from authoritative evidence

Bundle compilation SHALL select inputs according to the effective document
policy rather than directory scan order. Every materialized input SHALL have a
current ledger record whose digest matches the source bytes. Missing,
unrecorded, stale, or ambiguous mandatory input SHALL fail compilation with the
exact kind, path, and repair action; it SHALL not be silently omitted.

#### Scenario: A recorded source has drifted

- **GIVEN** the ledger records one digest for the design document
- **WHEN** the file bytes have changed
- **THEN** bundle compilation fails closed
- **AND** instructs the caller to re-record and re-read the document.

#### Scenario: Policy determines input order and reasons

- **WHEN** a Build bundle is compiled
- **THEN** proposal, OpenSpec design, tasks, Superpowers design, ADR, delta
  specs, Superpowers plan, and plan appear in policy order
- **AND** every entry has a nonempty policy-owned reason.

### Requirement: Context Bundle budget SHALL be explicit and bounded

The compiler SHALL report `maxBytes` and `usedBytes`. It SHALL apply only
deterministic full/summary/reference modes declared by policy. If mandatory
materialized content cannot fit the allowed budget, compilation SHALL fail with
an over-budget diagnostic instead of truncating content nondeterministically.

#### Scenario: Mandatory inputs exceed the requested budget

- **WHEN** mandatory bundle inputs exceed `maxBytes`
- **THEN** compilation exits non-zero
- **AND** reports required and available bytes
- **AND** emits no valid aggregate digest.

### Requirement: Context Bundle consumption SHALL detect drift

A consumer SHALL be able to re-hash every materialized input and the canonical
bundle payload before use. A mismatch SHALL invalidate the bundle and require a
new compile/read cycle. A Context Bundle SHALL remain a derived artifact and
SHALL NOT replace canonical Change state or the document ledger.

#### Scenario: Source changes after bundle compilation

- **WHEN** a source file changes after bundle generation
- **THEN** bundle verification fails before a governed mutation
- **AND** no old digest is rewritten or accepted as current evidence.
